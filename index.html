			When you want to become more musculair or want to lose wait, the first thing you think of is working out. With working out you burn caloriÃ«s. The only thing is that you won't lose weight if you only workout. You also need to go on a diet, because as long as you don't have a calorie deflict &#40;eating less calories then your body uses on a day &#41;you won't lose weight. There are a lot of websites where you can calculate the amount of macros you need. On webiste that i recommend is <a href="https://cleannutrition.nl/caloriebehoefte-berekenen/"> this </a> website. 


			In the table down here the macro's that Matthijs needs to take in are displayed. He has to take this every single day in order to gain weight and get a higher fat percentage.
